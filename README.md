## Emergency & Safety 🔔

Small feature with real-world value: a standout Emergency button has been added.

- Tap the floating **🆘** button to call your saved emergency contact and attempt to send your location via SMS or the device's sharing options.
- Save or update the contact via the Emergency settings modal (open the modal if no contact is saved).
- Voice-trigger: enable the microphone (🎤) and say **"I need help"** to trigger the emergency action.

Notes & limitations:
- Location and microphone require user permission. If location is denied, a message without coordinates will be sent.
- SMS, tel: and Web Share behaviors depend on the user's device and browser (mobile browsers offer the best experience).
- Speech recognition support varies by browser; if not available, the voice toggle will indicate it's disabled.

Please test on the target device (mobile recommended) and let us know if you want this to also send a network alert to a server or emergency service (would require backend integration).
